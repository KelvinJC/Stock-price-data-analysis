# Stock price analysis
Analysis of the performance of Tesla and Gamestop stocks

For this project, I sourced data via two methods. Web scraping for company revenues and API calls through yfinance for stock prices. Then I carried out some data cleaning, transformation before display on trendline charts.

NB: Github does not display charts made with Plotly. Until that's fixed you can click [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/KelvinJC/Stock-price-data-analysis/blob/main/Stock%20prices%20analysis.ipynb) to view the charts.
